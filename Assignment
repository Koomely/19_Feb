1. Go over the the terraform training on pluralsight.  -  https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/terraform-getting-started/table-of-contents

2. Setup the following with terraform:

- VPC ( with all required components )

- 2 X private subnet 

- 2 X public subnet

- place a server in each subnet (t2.micro)

3. Create an IAM Role and attach policy that allows creating vpc, subnets and instances and attach it to one of the servers in your private subnet.

4. Connect to the server with the role, copy terraform files and execute it without providing secret key and access key to terraform.

5. Save configuration with terraforming gem and delete instances (see below)



once done, please export the configuration for review using this tool:  

https://github.com/dtan4/terraforming  (should be self explanatory but we will upload our tutorial)

once exported you can (and should) delete it to save money on your AWS account



For the brave:

1. Use data source to find all Availability Zones and iterate over the array to place servers there.

2. Find how find AWS credentials in the instance with attached IAM Role
